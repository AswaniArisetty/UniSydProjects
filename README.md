o# UniSydProjects
These are the projects done as part of a cloud computing course.
Projects are part of graded assignments on different concepts , namely Hadoop Map Reduce , Apache Spark and Apache Flink.
MR and Spark were done using Python. I have used Flink Java API for the Apriori Project (Frequent Itemsets and Association rules)
